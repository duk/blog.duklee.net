There was this article that was questioning dogs make people happy argument. It says something like it's not dogs that make people happy, but generally happier people get dogs.

It's something interesting to think about. 

Does homework make kids smarter? or smart kids will do a good job on homework? Which one comes first?

Homework is something that has never been proven to "help" kids, but it's one of many shitty things that we "just" do since we've been doing it over years. No data. Just fucking gut feeling bullshitism. 

Currently I am reading a book called "Superforecasting" and it's really eye-opening.
