1. I want to make lots of money.I don't believe in "money doesn't buy your happiness"
2. I read a lot. But I don't force myself to finish a book. It's an author's job to write well and has something intelligent to say. And I do not read novels. 
3. But funnily enough my favorite authors so far are Ernest Hemingway and Roald Dahl.
4. I am proud of my kids.
