I had a weird issue when I upgrade my Ubuntu 16.04 to 18.04; Internet got really slow, almost unusuable slow. That was the reason why I downgraded to 16.04 a few months ago. Somehow I hoped that they would have resolved the issue, but it was still there.

The simple solution for me was to add Google DNS 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 to dns server. I didn't have to do that on 16.04. I wonder why. But at least I got it faster again.
