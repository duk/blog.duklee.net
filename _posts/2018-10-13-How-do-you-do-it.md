Sometimes I get this question about my kids. "How do you do it?" Yeah. My kids are pretty awesome. 

It's exactly those two things that you automatically assume to be false statements are what made my kids better than yours.

1. They are smarter and more talented than your kids from the get-go.
2. I am a better parent than you. 

That's it. Hope that helps.
