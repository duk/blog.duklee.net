<p>Here is how I measure if someone is smart or not.</p>

<ol>
  <li>education credentials: The better education you have, the more benefit of doubt I would give you. I would say some shit like ‘he does dumb things, but he did go to Havard. What the fuck?’ Not a requirement, but it helps shallow people like me. And there are tons of us.</li>
  <li>Well spokeness. From my experience, when I know my shit inside out, I speak well. I stumble on things I am not too familiar with. So learn to speak well. Stop with fillers already. um.. um.. um..</li>
  <li>Signal and Noises. I could care less on what I call “Jeopardy” knowledge. You know one of those who knows a lot of shit on a lot of things. That can impress some folks at parties. Nothing more.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="money-and-fame-sticking-with-verifiables">Money and Fame. Sticking with verifiables.</h1>

<p>Most people think their kids are smart. Not true. 80/20 rule applies to every fucking thing in life. Most likely than not, your kids belong in 80, not 20.</p>

<p>Smart ones read a lot. No exception. It’s not just the act of reading that make them smart. It’s the end result that helps them become smarter. Books do make you smart. Period. Some people always say this shit when someone talks about how harmful digital consumption is. Their argument is always people used to say the same shit about reading books. So you think checking facebook and reading a book are the same thing? That tells everything I need to know about your brain capacity. I buy a lot of books. Fortunately my son reads a lot. And the funny thing is the more you read, the faster you can read. These sentences get processed quicker and quicker. You start forming these patterns of words, your brain start grouping them together. Things get processed in chunks. Read books. Some authors, philosophers pondered these ideas throughout their lives. You are stealing them in a few day. And it costs you around $10. The best and the cheapest investment you can ever make.</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought about where my career is at this point alot. I do not have that much time left when it comes to career. I am quickly becoming that person that I used to hate when I was a junior developer; old and difficult.</p>

<p>But I think constant self-assessment is very import. It’s tough and sad sometimes. But you have to do it. And you will have to pivot if you are not reaching your goal. I don’t even know what my goal is. And now I am thinking my goal was all messed up.</p>

<p>First, goal needs to be verifiable. And in this world, there should be only two goals in life; money and fame. And probably the two go in hand in hand. If I do my best work, money will just fall onto my laps. It sounds virtuous, but does that really happen?</p>

<p>Money is money. Doesn’t matter where and how you make it. But I want to make it the right way. The right way for me would be not to screw other human beings. I do not want to make someone work 24 hours a day away from his family to make myself rich. And I could care less about fame. So my goal is set. Making as much money as possible. So how do I achieve that goal?</p>

<p>Then you go back to where you are right now. Continue doing what I am doing will help me achieve that goal? Keeping my head down coding away? The answer is no. Then I need a plan. How am I planning to achieve my goal of making lots of money.</p>

<p>I also need to take any ambiguity out of my goal. What’s “lots of money” for me? At this point, if I can pull in my salry level or little higher without doing my current work, that sould be a good smart.</p>

<p>Then think about risk. How much risk are you willing to to take? That’s always important. But there are different types of risk. Dumb risk and smart risk. Dumb risk would be something that you would put in a lot of money then lose everything and be on debt. Smart risk would be something that you can learn something out of and cause minimal financial risk.</p>

<p>I am currently thinking a few things. Some are low risk and some are high risk. I am thinking about doing low risk things and put that money into higher risk things to balance it out. And I am trying to make most of things to be as low risk as possible. How? I will delegate most work to machine. I am not into working night and day; but I do it a lof of when it is about my own project. So I get it when people say you start working alot when it’s your own business. I sorta see myself doing that as well.</p>

<h1 id="went-sideways-again-back-to-the-point">Went sideways again. Back to the point</h1>

<p>I always think I am smart enough. But looking around, I can’t really back it up. The only thing I am clinging on was that IQ test that I took when I was in middle school which I scored 145. But I did not go to elite school. Never really studied hard. Schools always bored me for some reason. So sometimes I need to wake the hell up and realize that my career is shit. But then again. Isn’t most people’s career the same? When I meet people now, I can see so clearly. And they are where they are because how they are. And they will never get anywhere higher than where they are. The system is alwasy triangle shaped. There are less as you move up. That’s why most people’s career gets suck at middle manager position and ends there. I don’t have what it takes to even get there. I am just not kiss-assy enough.</p>

<p>But I do not want to wonder on my deathbed if I could’ve done better. Before it is too late, I want to find out if I am really smart. And I came to a conclusion that only money that prove that I am or not. I am an engineer and money is the only verifiable validation of being smart.</p>
