    <p>This is Cowboys QB Dak Prescott’s 3rd year. And he is not that good right now. He caught everyone off guard on his rookie year then had a down year last year and he is having a really bad year this year.</p>

<p>There aren’t that many QBs who can overcome a bad team or a bad management. I guess most of us are Dak Prescott. Again it’s 80/20. And maybe you and I belong in 80. We need a right team. We need a right company. We need a right manager to thrive. We can perform at our highest level but we do need a right environment to do so. So don’t feel bad if you think you are in a rut and not performing as well as you hoped. Maybe you just need a better manager or a better team to thrive in.</p>

<p>Most of us are not Aaron Rogers or Tom Brady and that’s ok.</p>
