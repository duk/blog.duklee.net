Could they pick better presenters? Geez. So unpolished presentation.

It was a strange event that made me worry about overall health of the company. Did they start hiring "wrong" people? Is that what's happening in there? I've read an article about Larry Page being missing in action. Has the founders lost interest in running Google?
