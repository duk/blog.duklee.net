I sold all of my stocks when Trump got elected. Then it just kept going up and up. I don't think anyone can predict the market, but I know one thing; what goes up will eventually come down. It might go up longer than usual. It might go down longer than usual. But it always does. I hope I get one of those lifetime opporunity to make money off stock market; you make money when you buy, not sell. 

Recently I've been fascinated by the whold stock market. So started reading a lot of books on it. I am not quite done yet, but I felt I needed to educate myself before going back into the market. 

Hopefully down trend continues.
