People used to follow regional teams. But I am not sure if that will be the case in the future. My son who is 11 years old seems to follow star athletes, not a team. I just saw a video clip of Detroit Pistons home game and it almost half of the seats looked empty. I am sure it would be full when the Warriors were in town; kids in Detroit want to see Durant, Curry, Klay and Boogie.
