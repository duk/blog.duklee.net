When you think about your job, you have to ask this question; is my salary worth third of my life?

I am way past thinking about my passion and what not. I am training myself to think everything in terms of money. Again, money is one of the few verifiable measurement. Happiness is all about mindset. And mindsets vary. Someone said this. "A successful man is someone who does whatever the fuck he/she wants between waking up and going to bed." That statement makes sense to me. And I think money does allow me to achieve that without impacting my family.
