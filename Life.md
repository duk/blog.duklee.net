1. Be wary of pretentious people.
2. If you don't have a people skill, you better be super smart. Talent can overcome a lot of personal flaws. Good people skill can overcome void of talent. 
3. People show you who they are, believe them.
4. Whatever you are doing at one point, keep asking yourself this question, "What I am doing right now will make me money?" That question will keep you focused. Money isn't everything. Just like everything in life, money can help you or money can control you. But in capitalist society money is the only thing can be "measured" when you talk about success and quality of life. Don't listen to people who say money doesn't bring happiness. It kinda does. Money provides you a freedom to do whatever the fuck you feel like doing. If that type of freedom does't your bring happiness, I don't know what will. So if you start checking facebook, apply that question to yourself. The answer is fuck no. Then you fucking stop wasting your life on facebook. You are checking Instagram, ask that same question again, the answer is no again. So you refocus.
5. Read lots of books. I am not sure if intelligent people read more or reading make people intelligent. But reading books is the best and cheapest investment you can make.
6. Always worst case scenario. All algorithms come with best scenario and worst scenario. The worst scenario is called Big O notation. And plan your life based on worst possible scenario. Most people live with the best possible scenario and I am not sure that's a good thing.
7. Master tools of your choice. I am sure how many people can touchtype including numbers + symbols, brackets, curly brackets and possibly everything on your keyboard. Master your tools. Here is a solution for you; stick with one tool each. Stick with one keyboard. Stick with one IDE. Master all the shortcut keys. Master touchtyping. You want using tools become almost automatic so that you stay in your flow state. You don't want to worry about what key to type and so forth. Master your tools.
8. Master your craft, but pick the right craft. I had a coworker who used to be a .net developer. Then switched to JAVA, then switch to become a devop. Now he is going to Microsoft making a lot more than what he is making right now. Mastering your craft will get you comfortable life. But picking a right craft to master is equally important.
9. Happiness comes from freedom. Find a way to get more freedom. 
10. Be a great parent by actions, not by words. 
11. Smart phones are toxic. Prevent your kids from using it.
