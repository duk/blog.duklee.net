What's the point of knowing someone who is dumb? Just to kill time? Even having lunch with him will bore me out of my mind; he will not have anything interesting to say.

How to spot a dumb people.

1. They never read.
2. They have strong opinions about everything. And they confuse convictions with facts. e.g. religion is a conviction. You can't prove it. But they act like it's factual. 
3. They are religious. I've met some smart folks who are religious. But most have been dumb. Dumb people are easily fooled.
