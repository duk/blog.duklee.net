# Time

Time is the single most important asset you have. Everyone gets 24 hours day. It's up to you how you spend it. Do you want to spend it on commute? I personally can't believe some people are willing to spend 4+ hours on commuting back and forth.

So you really have to be mindful on where you spend your time one. So whenever you are about to do something, ask yourself this question.

"Will this thing that I am about to do be translating into money?"

There are some activities that you can't fuck with.

1. sleep. The most important activity to have highly functioning brain. 
2. Off cycle. You need to do some dumb things between highly active brain sessions. That's when great ideas come, solutions pop and so forth. So do not feel bad about watching a football game or two. Your brain does need that off cycle to function better.

And here are some activities that worth your time.

1. Reading a book.
2. Learning a new thing.
3. Mastering your craft.
4. Socializing with people who are smarter than you.

And things you must avoid.

1. social networking garbage.
2. shopping. (What I wear does impact how I function. If my clothes and shoes don't fit right, I can't function at a high level. But do not shop just for the sake of shopping)
3. Socializing with dumb fucks. You gain nothing out of it.
4. Reading news. Now News is just opinions. And it's so fucking curated to fit your taste by all these ad companies that it's not even reality. I stay away from News all together.
