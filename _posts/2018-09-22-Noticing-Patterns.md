# Big Data and Machine Learning

Will these two most hyped buzzwords can help me with that? This is something I need to look into. What facinates me about this machine learning is that it still need a guidance of a smart person. At this point, I don't think machine learning alone can do much; it hasn't proved that yet. Even Nate Silver missed on Donald Trump election; he didn't really missed since he was talking about probabilty, not absolute prediction. Right now, these things really keep me up at night. So difficult, so facinating, and so promising.  

# Spelling Bee and baby steps

Currently my major focus is on figuring out patterns in English words and spellings. I am trying to help my son and daughter better prepared for next year's spelling bee; my son won his school bee, moved on to county bee and made it to national scrips's bee competition this year. It's a small dataset; about 250k in Webster Unabridged. And they don't change. So it's a good size fixed dataset I can play with to learn how to figure out patterns from something that seeems no random. I just don't see how anything can be completely random. We are animals. Animals are mostly predictable and we form habits. That fact has to affect how we speak as well. 

I don't think there is a complete random in life. Just more complex random that few can see.
