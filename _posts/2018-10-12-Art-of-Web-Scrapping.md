It just hit me today; I should just scrap the whole html. Http request is expensive. Bring everything back to local drive. Then you have everything you need locally rather over the wire. Then you can do anything with it.

I've already scrapped the same website multiple times because I forgot to cherrypick something off pages. My puppeteer script is now a lot simpler with fewer errors.
