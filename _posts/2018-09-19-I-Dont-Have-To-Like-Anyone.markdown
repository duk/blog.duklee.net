Most people are confused about "relationship": you don't have to like anybody. There are a few people in my life that I "have" to like; my wife and my kids. Other than those, I don't put people on separate layers. I don't differentiate my niece and my son's friend. Other than my own kids, it's all the same. Of course, they don't have to like me either. I don't really care. But I am not going to try to like someone just because they are somewhat "closer" to me. Entitlement has no place in anywhere and it sure doesn't have a place in "relationship." Do you think it would benefit you for me to like you? Then be polite to me. It doesn't matter that I like you? Then don't bother. 

But I will not go out of my way to "like" someone.
