<meta name="description" content="We are born. Genes you inherited matter. Environments you inherited matter. So if you think about it, it’s all luck in the beginning. You didn’t earn your genes nor did you earn your environment. That’s why we have to have empathy on some folks for both reasons. In my case, the gene part was pretty decent, but I am not so sure about environment part. Parenting does matter. But we need well balanced parenting. goldie lock of parenting I call it. Too much not good. Too little not good either. What we really need to do as a parent is to pay undivided attention when they ask for it. And help them to become independent. Don’t be a helicopter parent. Don’t do their homework for them. And get off your fucking phone when your kid wants to talk to you once in awhile. Get your kids to love books. Then your parenting is half done. but I am starting to see a pattern where dumb kids will ever like reading books. It just does not excite them. The dumber the kid is the detailed dumb shit they like. Let me explain. Smart kids like dumb toys such as blocks and legos. Dumb kids like detailed toys like video fucking games, robots and shit like that. Books require brain work. And I noticed that kids whom I deem dumb do not like reading books. So I don’t think you can force your kids to love reading books. If you can afford it, give your kids an opportunity to try different things. Some might stick. Over the years, I’ve come to conclusion that you can’t really force your kids to be great at anything; they will have to want it. But they might not find out what they love if they never get exposed to them. But again, your environment comes into picture again. Some parents have time and money to do so and some parents don’t." />

<p>These five things are the ones that I firmly believe. And there are some things that I think I should teach my kids about.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Race and racism.</li>
  <li>Finance. Money.</li>
