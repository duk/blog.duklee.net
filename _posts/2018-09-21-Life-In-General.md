# Most people's career trajectory

1. Go to School.
2. Get a job.
3. Get promoted to a middle management if you work hard and get lucky.
4. Stuck there.
5. Retire.

# Your wealth is the only verifiable measure stick for your success. You can have wealth in various ways.

1. Salary. 
2. Investments (Stock, Rental properties)
3. Owning a business.
4. Assets from inheritance or others.

Don't just look at salary of others and be depressed. Say my manager makes 50k or 100k more than what I make. But if I have a milllion dollar more in my bank. I will take him 10+ years to be where I am. My job is to build up wealth. Don't get caught up in salaries.

# The eariler you figure out who you are, the better you willl be off with whatever you are trying to accomplish.

1. Are you a risk taker?
2. Are you smart? Not your Mom thinks you are smart. But IQ test result, college credential type of verifiable smart. Everybody thinks they are smarter what they actually are. 
3. Are you a number guy? Right now, you have to be good at math to be successful. I sorta realized it today. You don't have to be good at it, but success will be easier to achieve if you are good at math.
4. Are you excellent at something? If you are not a risk taker, you will really have to be great at something; you will have to work for someone.
