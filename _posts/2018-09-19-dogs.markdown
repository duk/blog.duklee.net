I have this hypothesis. Parents who have crazy kids will have crazy dogs. I think people "behave well" when their basic needs are met. Their tummy is full. They get just enough attention from people they love; "just enough" is the key, you do not want to do too much. That does backfire.

Getting Cooper and Ginger was one of the best things I've done with my life. Dogs are indeed way better than humans. 

> “Owners with higher levels of stress may not have a relaxed relationship with their dogs, which can contribute to their annoyance about their dogs’ behavior, so they spend less time with them, increasing the anxiety in the dogs. In turn, a dog’s behaviors may annoy the owner and may be a source of stress for him or her, which affects his or her perceived happiness.” [link](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fellow-creatures/201809/well-behaved-dogs-may-have-happier-owners)
