I am currently finishing up a book called "Dark Pools" and this book allows me to understand a little bit better about the stock market. 

Algorithms are driving the prices most of time. And human investors are reacting to that. If you think about it, machine controlling humans isn't future; it's already here.

Today it's going back up because most algorithms think they can make a "quick" buck buying them up and selling them off. That's all there is to it.
