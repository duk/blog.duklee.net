>But now, as Silicon Valley’s parents increasingly panic over the impact screens have on their children and move toward screen-free lifestyles, worries over a new digital divide are rising. It could happen that the children of poorer and middle-class parents will be raised by screens, while the children of Silicon Valley’s elite will be going back to wooden toys and the luxury of human interaction.

I haven't met a single phone-addicted kid whom I deemed intelligent. But now that I am struggling with "which one comes first" dillema, I won't be jumping into conclusion. 

Internet can be a great thing for learning. But I highly doubt that teens use it as such. Especially I don't think you can do research on a phone.

So till I meet a phone-addicted kid whom I deem smart, I will assume that phone is bad.
