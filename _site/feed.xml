One version is the person you “think” you are. And there is another version that others think who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people’s opnion about you does not really matter. But some people’s opinion does matter. For example, what your boss thinks of you matters. What your teacher thinks of you unfortunately matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people include myself live a life where what others think of you matter more. But successful people live a life of what they think of themselves matter more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">You have two versions.

&lt;p&gt;I am way past thinking about my passion and what not. I am training myself to think everything in terms of money. Again, money is one of the few verifiable measurement. Happiness is all about mindset. And mindsets vary. Someone said this. “A successful man is someone who does whatever the fuck he/she wants between waking up and going to bed.” That statement makes sense to me.

  &lt;li&gt;We are born.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Genes you inherited matter. Environments you inherited matter. So if you think about it, it’s all luck in the beginning. You didn’t earn your genes nor did you earn your environment. That’s why we have to have empathy on some folks for both reasons. In my case, the gene part was pretty decent, but I am not so sure about environment part.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parenting does matter. But we need well balanced parenting. goldie lock of parenting I call it. Too much not good. Too little not good either. What we really need to do as a parent is to pay undivided attention when they ask for it. And help them to become independent. Don’t be a helicopter parent. Don’t do their homework for them. And get off your fucking phone when your kid wants to talk to you once in awhile.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get your kids to love books. Then your parenting is half done. but I am starting to see a pattern where dumb kids will ever like reading books. It just does not excite them. The dumber the kid is the detailed dumb shit they like. Let me explain. Smart kids like dumb toys such as blocks and legos. Dumb kids like detailed toys like video fucking games, robots and shit like that. Books require brain work. And I noticed that kids whom I deem dumb do not like reading books. So I don’t think you can force your kids to love reading books.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you can afford it, give your kids an opportunity to try different things. Some might stick. Over the years, I’ve come to conclusion that you can’t really force your kids to be great at anything; they will have to want it. But they might not find out what they love if they never get exposed to them. But again, your environment comes into picture again. Some parents have time and money to do so and some parents don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These five things are the ones that I firmly believe. And there are some things that I think I should teach my kids about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Race and racism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finance. Money.&lt;/li&gt;

And he is not that good right now. He caught everyone off guard on his rookie year then had a down year last year and he is having a really bad year this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren’t that many QBs who can overcome a bad team or a bad management. I guess most of us are Dak Prescott. Again it’s 80/20. And maybe you and I belong in 80. We need a right team. We need a right company. We need a right manager to thrive. We can perform at our highest level but we do need a right environment to do so. So don’t feel bad if you think you are in a rut and not performing as well as you hoped. Maybe you just need a better manager or a better team to thrive in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s something interesting to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does homework make kids smarter? or smart kids will do a good job on homework? Which one comes first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homework is something that has never been proven to “help” kids, but it’s one of many shitty things that we “just” do since we’ve been doing it over years. No data. Just fucking gut feeling bullshitism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If in doubt, Everett recommends reflecting on the entire chain of decisions that has led to where you are now, and considering the counterfactuals – in other words, what’s true and not true, a reality check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If presented with the same choice again, would I make the same decision? If not – why not?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, it’s a simple idea, with global ramifications. And ultimately, it all goes back to the first lesson of gambling. Any good poker player knows when to fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is the single most important asset you have. Everyone gets 24 hours day. It’s up to you how you spend it. Do you want to spend it on commute? I personally can’t believe some people are willing to spend 4+ hours on commuting back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you really have to be mindful on where you spend your time one. So whenever you are about to do something, ask yourself this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Will this thing that I am about to do be translating into money?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some activities that you can’t fuck with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sleep. The most important activity to have highly functioning brain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Off cycle. You need to do some dumb things between highly active brain sessions. That’s when great ideas come, solutions pop and so forth. So do not feel bad about watching a football game or two. Your brain does need that off cycle to function better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are some activities that worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading a book.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning a new thing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mastering your craft.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Socializing with people who are smarter than you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And things you must avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;social networking garbage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shopping. (What I wear does impact how I function. If my clothes and shoes don’t fit right, I can’t function at a high level. But do not shop just for the sake of shopping)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Socializing with dumb fucks. You gain nothing out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading news. Now News is just opinions. And it’s so fucking curated to fit your taste by all these ad companies that it’s not even reality. I stay away from News all together.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What if you can pick up patterns that siginals upcoming market collapse?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make some money off stock market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What if you can pick up patterns that siginal what makes a great athletes?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make some money off sport betting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;big-data-and-machine-learning&quot;&gt;Big Data and Machine Learning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will these two most hyped buzzwords can help me with that? This is something I need to look into. What facinates me about this machine learning is that it still need a guidance of a smart person. At this point, I don’t think machine learning alone can do much; it hasn’t proved that yet. Even Nate Silver missed on Donald Trump election; he didn’t really missed since he was talking about probabilty, not absolute prediction. Right now, these things really keep me up at night. So difficult, so facinating, and so promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;spelling-bee-and-baby-steps&quot;&gt;Spelling Bee and baby steps&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently my major focus is on figuring out patterns in English words and spellings. I am trying to help my son and daughter better prepared for next year’s spelling bee; my son won his school bee, moved on to county bee and made it to national scrips’s bee competition this year. It’s a small dataset; about 250k in Webster Unabridged. And they don’t change. So it’s a good size fixed dataset I can play with to learn how to figure out patterns from something that seeems no random. I just don’t see how anything can be completely random. We are animals. Animals are mostly predictable and we form habits. That fact has to affect how we speak as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think there is a complete random in life. Just more complex random that few can see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Patterns</summary></entry></feed>
