# Big Data and Machine Learning

Will these two most hyped buzzwords can help me with that? This is something I need to look into. What facinates me about this machine learning is that it still need a guidance of a smart person. At this point, I don't think machine learning alone can do much; it hasn't proved that yet. Even Nate Silver missed on Donald Trump election; he didn't really missed since he was talking about probabilty, not absolute prediction. Right now, these things really keep me up at night. So difficult, so facinating, and so promising.
